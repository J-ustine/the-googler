# The Googler app

It is a note-taking web application where you can add your note. It has been built in one day for the international femhack organized by [NUME](https://femhack.nuwe.io/).

# Requirements

The app prototype has to allow their users to:

* Login and register (no persistence required)
* Take a new note that contains two kinds of text:
  * Title
  * Description
* Visualize the notes in a grid/list view
* Add tags to the notes
* Delete notes
* Edit notes

# Project access

You will be able to access this project by running the following command :
`npm start`

# Documentation Decisions taken

**React** was chosen for this project for its ability to be fast, scalable, and simple.
<br/>
**React-router** was preferred in this project because it allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.
<br/>
**Bootstrap** did not have its usual use in this project because I wanted to make an app with the colors and design of NUWE and femhack. So I preferred to stay on classic css.
